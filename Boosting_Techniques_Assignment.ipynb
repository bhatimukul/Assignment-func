        "Ans.Boosting is an **ensemble learning technique** in machine learning that combines multiple weak learners (typically decision trees) to create a strong learner. It works by training models sequentially, with each new model focusing on correcting the mistakes of the previous ones.\n",

        "### How Boosting Works:\n",
        "1. A weak model (often a shallow decision tree) is trained on the data.\n",

        "CatBoost (Categorical Boosting) is **designed specifically for handling categorical data efficiently**. Unlike other boosting algorithms like **XGBoost and LightGBM**, which require manual encoding (e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding), **CatBoost processes categorical features automatically**.  \n",
