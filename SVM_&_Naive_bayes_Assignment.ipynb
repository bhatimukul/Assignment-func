        "1. **Finding the Optimal Hyperplane**  \n",
        "   - SVM finds the best decision boundary (hyperplane) that **maximizes the margin** between different classes.\n",
        "   - The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class. These closest points are called **support vectors**.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Linear vs. Non-Linear Classification**  \n",
        "   - If the data is **linearly separable**, SVM finds a straight hyperplane.\n",
        "   - If the data is **not linearly separable**, SVM uses a technique called the **Kernel Trick** to transform data into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Concepts:**\n",
        "- **Support Vectors**: Data points that lie closest to the hyperplane and influence its position.\n",
        "- **Margin**: The gap between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from either class.\n",

        "Ans.### **Why is Naïve Bayes a Good Choice for Text Classification?**  \n",
        "\n",
        "Naïve Bayes is one of the **best-performing algorithms for text classification**, despite its simplicity. It is widely used for **spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and topic categorization** because of the following reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **✅ 1. Works Well with High-Dimensional Data**  \n",
        "- In text classification, each **unique word is a feature** → leading to thousands or even millions of features.  \n",
        "- **Naïve Bayes handles large feature spaces efficiently** because it treats features independently.  \n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 **Example:** In spam detection, words like “free” and “win” act as independent features.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **✅ 2. Computationally Fast and Scalable**  \n",
        "- **Time Complexity: \\( O(n) \\)** (linear in number of features).  \n",
        "- Training is **almost instant**, even on large datasets.  \n",
        "- Suitable for **real-time applications** like spam filtering.  \n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 **Example:** Gmail processes **millions of emails per second** using probabilistic models like Naïve Bayes.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **✅ 3. Works Well with Small Datasets**  \n",
        "- Unlike deep learning, **Naïve Bayes doesn’t need massive labeled data** to work effectively.  \n",
        "- Still provides **good accuracy** even with limited training data.  \n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 **Example:** In sentiment analysis, even a few hundred labeled reviews can be enough.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **✅ 4. Handles Missing Features Naturally**  \n",
        "- If a word **does not appear** in a document, it is simply ignored in probability calculations.  \n",
        "- Unlike Decision Trees or k-NN, **Naïve Bayes doesn’t require imputation for missing values**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 **Example:** If the word \"discount\" is missing from a review, the classifier still works fine using other words.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **✅ 5. Robust to Irrelevant Features**  \n",
        "- Since each feature is **weighted probabilistically**, **irrelevant words do not impact classification significantly**.  \n",
        "- Works well with **feature selection techniques** like **TF-IDF**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 **Example:** Stopwords like \"the\" and \"is\" have little impact on classification.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **✅ 6. Can Handle Imbalanced Data**  \n",
        "- Unlike SVM or Decision Trees, **Naïve Bayes doesn’t get biased towards majority classes**.  \n",
        "- The probability-based approach still captures rare category patterns.  \n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 **Example:** In medical diagnosis, if **99% of patients are healthy**, Naïve Bayes can still detect rare diseases effectively.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **✅ 7. Probabilistic Interpretation**  \n",
        "- Instead of just predicting a class label, Naïve Bayes **provides probability scores** for each class.  \n",
        "- Helps in applications where **uncertainty matters** (e.g., risk assessment).  \n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 **Example:** A spam filter might say:  \n",
        "   - **90% probability** email is spam  \n",
        "   - **10% probability** email is not spam  \n",

        "\n",
        "## **📌 When to Use Naïve Bayes for Text Classification?**  \n",
        "✅ **Spam Filtering** → \"Buy now\" & \"win a prize\" detected as spam.  \n",
        "✅ **Sentiment Analysis** → \"Great movie!\" vs. \"Worst experience ever.\"  \n",
        "✅ **News Categorization** → \"Stock market crashes\" → Finance.  \n",
