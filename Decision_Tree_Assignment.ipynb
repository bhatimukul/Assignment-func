        "Ans.A **Decision Tree** is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It models decisions using a tree-like structure, where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, each branch represents an outcome, and each leaf node represents a final classification or prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How Does a Decision Tree Work?**\n",
        "1. **Start with the Root Node:**  \n",
        "   - The algorithm selects the best feature (attribute) to split the data based on criteria like **Gini Impurity**, **Entropy (Information Gain)**, or **Mean Squared Error (for regression).**\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Recursive Splitting:**  \n",
        "   - The dataset is divided into subsets based on feature values.\n",
        "   - The process continues recursively, creating child nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Stopping Criteria:**  \n",
        "   - Splitting stops when:\n",
        "     - A node becomes pure (all samples belong to one class).\n",
        "     - A maximum depth is reached.\n",
        "     - Further splitting does not improve results significantly.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Prediction:**  \n",
        "   - For classification: A sample follows the path in the tree until it reaches a leaf node, which gives the predicted class.\n",
        "   - For regression: The average value of samples in a leaf node is used as the prediction.\n",
